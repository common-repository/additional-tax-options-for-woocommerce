== Description ==

### This plugin adds the following tax options for WooCommerce: 

**1. Absorb the difference in tax rates, and charge the same "tax-inclusive" price to all customers**

* By default, when you enter price inclusive of taxes in WooCommerce, customers would be charged based on their location. So a customer in location with 10% tax would be charged different from the customer in a location with 15% tax. 

* With this option, you can choose to charge the same "tax-inclusive" price to all customers, irrespective of their location or tax rates. 

**2. For Local Pickup, charge tax based on customer's location instead of shop's base location**

* By default, when a customer selects the "Local Pickup" option for shipping, they are charged taxes based on your store's location, and not their billing/shipping location. 
* With this option, you can charge the tax for Local Pickup based on the customer's location.
